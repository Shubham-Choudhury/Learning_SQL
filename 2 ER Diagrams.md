# **ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAMS (ER-DIAGRAMS)**

Entity-Relationship(ER) model is a visual representation of the table's structure and the relationship between logically related tables.

In ER modeling the databases structure is represented as a diagram known as ER diagram(ERD). An entity relationship diagram is a common way to view data in a database. It gives a better understanding of the overall databases structure. It becomes easier to map the tables, their keys and relationships.

### **The ER diagram displays:**

- Table structure along with the column names and their data types.
- Primary and foreign key constraints.
- Relationships between tables.
